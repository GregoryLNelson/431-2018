# 431 Fall 2018 Class 04: 2018-09-06

## Today's Materials

- The slides are available [in PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class04/431_class-04-slides_2018.pdf) and [in R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class04/431_class-04-slides_2018.Rmd).
- The audio files will be posted after class.
- Today's main analysis involves some data from NHANES (which is the [National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm)), and this example is covered (in greater depth) in Chapters 3-6 of [our Course Notes](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-book/dataviz.html).
- Another analysis we'll discuss today is a more polished analysis of the Day 1 survey. 
    - Here is [the .csv file of the data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class04/surveyday1_2018.csv), the [R Markdown file for this analysis](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class04/class4-survey.Rmd), and the [HTML result](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class04/class4-survey.html).

## Deliverables Coming Soon

- [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework1) is due on Friday 2018-09-07 at Noon. Submit your R Markdown and HTML files via Canvas. 
    - We treat work arriving before 1 PM as on time. It is **far** better to turn in incomplete work on time than complete work late for these homework assignments.
    
## Minute Papers after Class 3

Details to come.

## Today's Announcements

### Get help at any time by emailing **431-help at case dot edu** or visiting Office Hours.

1. Apply the 15-minute rule. If you can't solve a problem in 15 minutes, **ask for help** either from us or from Google.
    - You are **absolutely supposed** to use Google and the TAs (and Dr. Love) to improve your code.

2. When asking for help with an R problem from **431-help at case dot edu**, we ask you to try to make it easier for us to help you. If you attach your R Markdown file, and a detailed explanation of the problem you see, we can often solve the problem in an email. Without the R Markdown file, we can rarely do anything except ask more questions.

3. When you get a response from one of us on **431-help at case dot edu** you'll notice we REPLY ALL so that all of the TAs (and Dr. Love) can see the result. If you need to respond, please fight your usual urge and **REPLY ALL** as well so that we can all still help.

### Professor Love is giving a research talk (together with Dr. Shari Bolen) on Friday morning

The talk is entitled "Racial and Ethnic Approaches to Community Health Grant: Hypertension Implementation in 9 Safety Net Clinics" and is from 9 to 10:30 AM in Room R219 at the Rammelkamp building on the campus of MetroHealth Medical Center. For more information, ask Dr. Love, or visit http://chrp.org/events/
