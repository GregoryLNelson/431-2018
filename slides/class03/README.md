- The main web site for this course is https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018.

## Deliverables Coming SOon

- Before Thursday' class
    - Read Chapters 5, 9, 10 and 13 of Jeff Leek's [The Elements of Data Analytic Style](https://leanpub.com/datastyle).
    - Complete the **Minute Paper After Class 03, which I'll explain in class today.**
- [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework1) is due on Friday 2018-09-07 at Noon. Submit your R Markdown and HTML files via Canvas. 
    - We treat work that arrives before 1 PM as on time. 
    - Work after that is late. **Don't be late**. It is **far, far** better to be incomplete than late for homework in this class.
- You need the [course software](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/software) up and running on your computer now. 
    - This means you have R, R Studio, the necessary R Packages, and the data for 431 on your machine and working for you. 
    - **We'll walk through everything today in class.** 
    - If you're still having trouble after class, contact a teaching assistant or Dr. Love (perhaps through **431-help**), as you'll need this working to do the homework assignment.

## Today's Announcements

### Materials added to our [Data and Code](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data) page

- I've added the age-love-analysis [R Markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class02/age-love-analysis.Rmd) used to generate the materials included in the slides presented in Class 02.
- I've also added the [2018 day 1 survey data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data/master/surveyday1_2018.csv) as a .csv file, and we'll use that data today in today's class.
- I'm going to do some live coding in today's class, during which **I will produce a file called Class3.Rmd. My pre-class version is also now posted to the page. Download it by clicking here.**

### On Getting Help from 431-help

When asking for help with an R problem from **431-help at case dot edu**, we ask you to try to make it easier for us to help you. Specifically...

- attach a copy of the R Markdown file you are working on,
- include a screenshot or copy-and-paste listing of the error you are generating, if that's the problem.
- attach a copy of the data set (if it's not about a homework assignment or other data set that we gave you),
- attach a copy of the HTML result (if you can create it), and

With the R Markdown file, and a detailed explanation of the problem you see, we can often solve the problem in an email. Without the R Markdown file, we can rarely do anything except ask more questions.

### Teaching Assistant Office Hours

A reminder that Teaching Assistant Office Hours are held in WG-56 (Computing Lab) or WG-67 (Student Lounge) on the ground floor of the Wood building, so be sure to look in both places if you need help. TA office hours started today. You'll find the schedule on the bottom of the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/calendar.md).
