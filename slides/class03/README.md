# 431 Fall 2018 Class 03: 2018-09-04

## Today's Slides

Class 3 slides are available in [PDF format](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class03/431_class-03-slides_2018.pdf), as well as in [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class03/431_class-03-slides_2018.Rmd).

Class 3 audio files will appear above, after class.

- The Getting Started in R document is available in [R Markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class03/431-getting-started-with-R.Rmd) and as [a PDF](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class03/431-getting-started-with-R.pdf).
- Today, we'll do some live coding. Useful files for that include:
    - A .csv file of the [2018 day 1 survey data](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data/master/surveyday1_2018.csv)
    - An R Markdown template called [YOURNAME-hw1.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class03/YOURNAME-hw1.Rmd) that I'll actually use in class as my starting point for live coding.
    - An R Markdown file called [class3-pre.Rmd](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class03/class3-pre.Rmd): my pre-class version, to save some typing.
        - You can also see [the HTML result of knitting this class3-pre file here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class03/class3-pre.html).
    - I'll also post the version I build live, to be called **class3live.Rmd**, after class.

## Get help at any time by emailing **431-help at case dot edu**.

Apply the 15-minute rule. If you can't solve a problem in 15 minutes, **ask for help** either from us or from Google.
    - You are **absolutely supposed** to use Google and the TAs (and Dr. Love) to improve your code.

## Deliverables Coming Soon

- Before Thursday' class
    - Read Chapters 5, 9, 10 and 13 of Jeff Leek's [The Elements of Data Analytic Style](https://leanpub.com/datastyle).
    - Complete the **Minute Paper After Class 03, which I'll explain in class today.**
- [Homework 1](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/homework/Homework1) is due on Friday 2018-09-07 at Noon. Submit your R Markdown and HTML files via Canvas. 
    - We treat work that arrives before 1 PM as on time. 
    - Work after that is late. **Don't be late**. It is **far, far** better to be incomplete than late for homework in this class.
- You need the [course software](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/software) up and running on your computer now. 
    - This means you have R, R Studio, the necessary R Packages, **and** the data for 431 working properly. 
    - If you're still having trouble after class, contact a teaching assistant or Dr. Love (perhaps through **431-help**), as you'll need this working to do the homework assignment.
- Dr. Love is available in/near this classroom or in his office (Wood WG 82-L) for 15 minutes before and 30 minutes after every class.

## Today's Announcements

### Materials added to our [Data and Code](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018-data) page

- I've added the age-love-analysis [R Markdown file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/master/slides/class02/age-love-analysis.Rmd) used to generate the materials included in the [slides for Class 2](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/edit/master/slides/class02), and if you want to see [the HTML result, here it is](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class03/age-love-analysis.html).

### On Getting Help from 431-help

When asking for help with an R problem from **431-help at case dot edu**, we ask you to try to make it easier for us to help you. Specifically...

- attach a copy of the R Markdown file you are working on,
- include a screenshot or copy-and-paste listing of the error you are generating, if that's the problem.
- attach a copy of the data set (if it's not about a homework assignment or other data set that we gave you),
- attach a copy of the HTML result (if you can create it), and

With the R Markdown file, and a detailed explanation of the problem you see, we can often solve the problem in an email. Without the R Markdown file, we can rarely do anything except ask more questions.

### Teaching Assistant Office Hours

A reminder that Teaching Assistant Office Hours are held in WG-56 (Computing Lab) or WG-67 (Student Lounge) on the ground floor of the Wood building, so be sure to look in both places if you need help. TA office hours started this morning, and continue Wednesday at noon. You'll find the complete schedule on the bottom of the [Course Calendar](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/calendar.md), and remember to contact us at **431-help at case dot edu** if you have questions at other times.
