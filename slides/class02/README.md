## Class 1 Age Guessing Data

At http://bit.ly/431-day1-2018-card-age-guesses, you will find a summary spreadsheet describing 2014-2018 data from this class on guessing the ages from the photographs we looked at last time. 

- Your class (2018) actually had the best average class guess pattern of any of the five years in which I've conducted this exercise. 
- Congratulations to groups I and D, which had the smallest average absolute errors.

## Other Data Gathered During Class 1

- A [csv file of the data from the Class 1 survey from 2014-2018](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class02/surveyday1_2018.csv) is provided above. It's called [surveyday1_2018.csv](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/slides/class02/surveyday1_2018.csv).
