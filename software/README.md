- Visit [this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/software/installation.md) for complete information on installing R and R Studio as well as obtaining the data and code you'll need in 431, on either a PC or a Macintosh computer.
- Visit [this link](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/blob/master/software/packages.md) for details on the R packages we're using in 431.

If you need more help, you might look at [this terrific resource for Installing R and R Studio](http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html) from Jenny Bryan and the STAT 545 project. These are the people responsible for the great [Happy Git with R](http://happygitwithr.com/) project, which is worth your time, too, if you intend to use Git and GitHub.

## Advice on Technology / System Requirements

- You will need a laptop computer in this class, not just an iPad or other tablet, but an actual computer.
- I wouldn't recommend a Chrome device for this purpose. Any reasonably recent PC or Macintosh machine will work well. You do not need a state of the art machine.
    - We've made some effort in terms of course requirements to set the bar low. 
    - You will need a laptop, either PC or Mac, but the style should be determined by your personal preferences and how you believe you will use the machine in your research life, I think. Dr. Love has a fairly old MacBook Air which he uses in class, and a series of desktop PCs at offices around Cleveland.
    - In this class, you'll be using R Studio and R, which look the same on either a PC or a Mac, and are free and open-source, so it's really your call. 
- All of the software we will use in this class is either free and open source, or available to you for free through your affiliation with CWRU.
