# Calendar

This is the calendar for Dr. Love's Section 1 of 431 in Fall 2018. All class meetings are scheduled for 1:00 PM to 2:15 PM in room E321-323 on the third floor of the Robbins building at the School of Medicine. 

The early classes (especially Classes 2-6) are more about R and R Studio than about "statistics". Once everyone's gotten rolling, our approach changes a bit to focus more on statistical concerns, and less on the technology.
