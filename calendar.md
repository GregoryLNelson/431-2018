# Calendar

This is an initial and tentative draft of the calendar for Dr. Love's Section 1 of 431 in Fall 2018. It will be replaced in time by a far more detailed document. All class meetings are scheduled for 1:00 PM to 2:15 PM in room E321 in the Robbins building at the School of Medicine. 

The early classes (especially Classes 2-6) are more about R and R Studio than about "statistics". Once everyone's gotten rolling, our approach changes a bit to focus more on statistical concerns, and less on the technology.
