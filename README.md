- If you're looking to get a jump on things, read the [Syllabus](https://thomaselove.github.io/2018-431-syllabus/), and [install the software we'll use on your computer](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/431-2018/tree/master/software). That's going to be the bulk of your assignment for our second class, on Thursday 2018-08-30.
